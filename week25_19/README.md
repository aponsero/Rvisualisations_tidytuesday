This week dataset came from week 25 of [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-06-18) 2019

The dataset is about bird counting and is available through [bird studies Canada](https://www.birdscanada.org/index.jsp) 
and was preprocessed [here](https://sharleenw.rbind.io/post/hamilton_cbc_part_1/hamilton-christmas-bird-count-part-1/)


## Data exploration (3h)
A dive into the dataset and getting some first plots.

## Infographic (3h)
Interesting how the import of SVG files from R is not really working. All text is lost and I needed to rewrite the legends by hand. Fun.
